# Create a very simply version of the memory card game (build upon it later). Completing this project is the most important over details of the game.
# Brainstorm - Think and draw out every part of the game before coding a single line.

# Basic outline of the game:
  • Player is presented with 12 total cards (4 each row).
  • The cards will be in the hidden position at start.
  • When player starts the game, the cards will be displayed for 8 seconds then hidden again.
  • If an incorrect matching card is found, the 2 cards will be hidden.
  • If the correct matching pair is found, the 2 cards remains visible.
  • If 4 incorrect attempts, player loses and game is over.
  • If all cards are correctly paired, player wins and game is won.

# Card game logic:
  • During the beginning of the game, 12 random cards will be generated and hidden. Use state to 'hold' the randomly generated cards.
  • Player clicking on a card will initiate the game by revealing that single card by changing image property for the card. This should change state and re-render.
    1. If it's the first card player clicked on, keep clicked card revealed. If it's NOT the first card clicked, create logic to deal with match/un-match card.

      if player clicks on a card that exists...
        toggle card visibility property in state...

    2. Store the current clicked card in React state to compare with second clicked card.

      if first clicked card...
        store unique id of card in state...
      if second clicked card....
        check if unique id of second card matches first card...
        if it matches...
          reset the state to null (empty)...
          keep both cards revealed...
        if id does NOT match...
          reset the state to null...
          increment error count...
          make both cards hidden again...

  • If there is an active 'revealed' card, the second card will check if it matches the first revealed card.
  • If there currently is no 'revealed' card after card click, the card should stay revealed.
  • If it matches, both cards remain revealed and becomes non clickable. If it does not match, both cards become hidden again. React state should track incorrect attempts.
  • If all cards have been paired, then the game is over. React state should track if game is in play game/end game status.
